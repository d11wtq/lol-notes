# Notes from Let Over Lambda

These are just code samples hacked together while reading
the somewhat mind-bending
[Let Over Lambda](http://letoverlambda.com/), which deals
with macro authoring in Lisp languages (mainly ANSI Common
Lisp).

I've put them here simply for my own future reference, not
for others to read.
